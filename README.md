# railway_management.c
The code is a simple railway management system in C. It has the following functions:

create(): This function creates a new node and adds it to the linked list.
insert(): This function inserts a new node at a specific position in the linked list.
delete(): This function deletes a node from the linked list.
print(): This function prints all the nodes in the linked list.
spcprint(): This function prints the details of a specific train.
The code first asks the user to enter the number of train details they want to enter. Then, it calls the create() function to create a new node for each train detail. The create() function prompts the user to enter the train number, capacity, arrival time, departure time, start place, and last station. Once the user has entered all the details, the create() function adds the new node to the linked list.

The code then prompts the user to select an option from the menu. The menu contains the following options:

Enter train details
Show details of all train
Insert the data
Delete the data
Exit
to get the details of specific train
The code performs the corresponding action for the selected option. For example, if the user selects option 2, the code calls the print() function to print all the nodes in the linked list.

The code continues to run until the user selects option 5 (exit).
